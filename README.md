# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. 

USES

Community and Ecosystem:

Python has a vibrant and supportive community of developers and contributors who actively contribute to libraries, frameworks, and resources.
The Python Package Index (PyPI) hosts thousands of third-party packages that extend Python's functionality, making it easier to integrate with other technologies and solve complex problems.
Platform Independence:

Python is platform-independent, meaning code written in Python can run unchanged on various platforms and operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and others.
This portability makes Python suitable for cross-platform development and deployment.
Integration Capabilities:

Python can easily integrate with other languages and technologies. It supports interoperability with C/C++, Java, .NET, and more through various mechanisms like APIs, libraries, and tools.
Example: Using Python's ctypes module to call C functions from Python code.

USES

Web Development: Python is widely used for web development due to frameworks like Django and Flask, which provide robust tools for building scalable and secure web applications.

Data Science and Machine Learning: Python has become the language of choice for data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn are extensively used in these domains.

Scripting and Automation: Python's simplicity and readability make it ideal for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks, system administration, and workflow automation.

Scientific Computing: Python is used in scientific computing for simulations, data visualization, and mathematical computations. Libraries like SciPy, SymPy, and BioPython support advanced scientific applications.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

Download Python Installer: Visit the official Python website.

Run the Installer: Once the download is complete, run the Python installer. Check the box "Add Python to PATH" 

Verify Installation: Open a command prompt (cmd.exe).Type python --version or python -V

Install virtualenv (Optional but Recommended):
Open a command prompt.

Use pip (Python's package installer) to install virtualenv:

Choose or create a directory where you want to store your Python projects. Open a command prompt in that directory.

Create a virtual environment using virtualenv and venv\Scripts\activate

While the virtual environment is active, install any Python packages using pip. They will be installed isolated within the virtual environment directory.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

# Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")

Comments:

The line # Simple Python program to print "Hello, World!" is a comment. Comments in Python start with the # symbol and are ignored by the interpreter. They are used to explain the code and make it more readable.

Print Statement:

print("Hello, World!") is the core statement of the program. It instructs Python to display the text "Hello, World!" on the console.
print() is a built-in Python function that outputs (prints) the specified message or value to the console.

String Literal:

"Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotes ("). In Python, strings are sequences of characters, and they can be enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Both are equivalent, but consistency is usually preferred.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without any decimal points. Example: 5, -10, 1000.

Float (float): Represents numbers with decimal points. Example: 3.14, 2.71828, -0.5.

String (str): Represents sequences of characters enclosed within single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ". Example: 'hello', "Python", "123".

Boolean (bool): Represents truth values True or False. Used in logical expressions and conditions. Example: True, False.

List: Represents ordered collections of items. Items in a list can be of any data type and are enclosed within square brackets [ ]. Example: [1, 2, 3], ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'].

Tuple: Similar to lists but immutable (cannot be changed). Items are enclosed within parentheses ( ). Example: (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c').

Dictionary (dict): Represents key-value pairs enclosed within curly braces { }. Each key is separated from its value by a colon :. Example: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}.

EXAMPLES:

# Integer variable
age = 25
print("Age:", age, "| Type:", type(age))

# Float variable
height = 1.75
print("Height:", height, "| Type:", type(height))

# String variable
name = "Alice"
print("Name:", name, "| Type:", type(name))

# Boolean variables
is_student = True
print("Is student?", is_student, "| Type:", type(is_student))

# List variable
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print("Fruits:", fruits, "| Type:", type(fruits))

# Tuple variable
coordinates = (10, 20)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates, "| Type:", type(coordinates))

# Dictionary variable
person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30, 'city': 'London'}
print("Person:", person, "| Type:", type(person))

# Set variable
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print("Unique numbers:", unique_numbers, "| Type:", type(unique_numbers))

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

    Conditional statements and loops are fundamental constructs in Python (and programming in general) that allow you to control the flow of execution based on certain conditions and to iterate over sequences of data.

   # Example of an if-else statement
age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not yet an adult.")

    # Example of a for loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

7. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code designed to perform a specific task.

IMPORTANCE:

Modularity: Functions help in organizing code into logical blocks, promoting reusability and reducing redundancy.

Abstraction: Functions hide complex details and provide a simple interface to interact with, making it easier to understand and use.

Code Reusability: Once defined, functions can be called multiple times from different parts of the program, avoiding code duplication.

def calculate_sum(a, b):
    """
    Function to calculate the sum of two numbers.
    
    Args:
    a (int or float): First number.
    b (int or float): Second number.
    
    Returns:
    int or float: Sum of a and b.
    """
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
num1 = 10
num2 = 5
result = calculate_sum(num1, num2)
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}")
The sum of 10 and 5 is: 15

Calling the Function:

num1 and num2 are variables holding the numbers 10 and 5, respectively.

result = calculate_sum(num1, num2) calls the calculate_sum function with arguments num1 and num2.

The returned result (15) is stored in the variable result.

Finally, print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {result}") prints the result "The sum of 10 and 5 is: 15".

8. Lists and Dictionaries:
  - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists (list):

Ordered collection of items.

Elements are indexed by integers starting from 0.

Elements can be accessed using their indices.

Elements can be of any data type (integers, floats, strings, etc.).

Use square brackets [ ] to define lists.

Dictionaries (dict):

Unordered collection of key-value pairs.

Elements are accessed using keys (which can be of any immutable data type like strings or integers).

Keys are unique within a dictionary, but values can be duplicated.

Use curly braces { } to define dictionaries, with each key-value pair separated by a colon :.

# Creating a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("List of Numbers:", numbers)

# Accessing elements in a list
print("First element of the list:", numbers[0])  # Accessing the first element
print("Last element of the list:", numbers[-1])  # Accessing the last element

# Modifying elements in a list
numbers[1] = 10  # Modifying the second element
print("Modified List:", numbers)

# Adding elements to a list
numbers.append(6)  # Adding a new element at the end
print("List after appending:", numbers)

# Removing elements from a list
removed_element = numbers.pop(2)  # Removing the third element (index 2)
print("List after removing element at index 2:", numbers)
print("Removed element:", removed_element)

# Creating a dictionary with key-value pairs
person = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
}
print("\nDictionary (Person):", person)

# Accessing values in a dictionary using keys
print("Name of the person:", person['name'])
print("Age of the person:", person['age'])

# Modifying values in a dictionary
person['city'] = 'San Francisco'
print("Modified Dictionary:", person)

# Adding new key-value pairs to a dictionary
person['occupation'] = 'Engineer'
print("Dictionary after adding occupation:", person)

# Removing key-value pairs from a dictionary
removed_value = person.pop('age')
print("Dictionary after removing age:", person)
print("Removed age:", removed_value)

9. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception Handling in Python allows you to gracefully manage runtime errors that may occur during the execution of your program. Errors, also known as exceptions, can disrupt the normal flow of a program if not handled properly. Python provides a mechanism to catch and deal with these exceptions using try, except, and optionally finally blocks.

EXAMPLES:
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
       
        result = a / b  # Division operation that may raise an exception
   
    except ZeroDivisionError:
       
        print("Error: Division by zero!")
        
        result = None  # Assigning None when division by zero occurs
    
    finally:
       
        print("Execution completed.")  # This will always execute return result
        
10. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

In Python, modules are files containing Python code that define functions, classes, and variables. They allow you to organize your Python code into reusable units. A package is a collection of Python modules bundled together in a directory. Packages help in organizing and structuring larger Python applications by grouping related modules.

Importing Modules:

To use the functionality defined in a module, you need to import it into your script using the import statement.
Once imported, you can access functions, classes, and variables defined in the module using dot notation (.).


EXAMPLES:

import math

# Using functions from the math module

print("Value of pi:", math.pi)

print("Square root of 16:", math.sqrt(16))

print("Cosine of 0 radians:", math.cos(0))

print("Factorial of 5:", math.factorial(5))


11. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Open the File: Use the open() function with the file path and mode ('r' for reading) to open the file.

Read the Content: Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to read the file content.

Close the File: Always close the file using the close() method to release system resources

FILES AND PRINTS:

# Reading from a file and printing its content

# File path
file_path = 'sample.txt'

# Open the file in read mode ('r')
try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the entire content of the file
        content = file.read()
        
        # Print the content
        print("Content of the file:")
        print(content)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: The file '{file_path}' does not exist.")

except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")

WRITES:

# Writing to a file

# List of strings to write to the file
lines_to_write = [
    "Hello, this is line 1.",
    "And this is line 2.",
    "Final line, number 3."
]

# File path to write to
output_file = 'output.txt'

# Open the file in write mode ('w')
try:
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        # Write each line from the list to the file
        for line in lines_to_write:
            file.write(line + '\n')  # Adding newline character at the end of each line

    print(f"Successfully wrote {len(lines_to_write)} lines to '{output_file}'.")

except IOError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
